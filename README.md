# CO2-emission-prediction-using-Regression-models
Experimenting with various regression models, we try to arrive at the most accurate prediction of the CO2 emission of a new car model. Following are the regression models we experiment with:-

• Single Variable Linear Regression

• Multiple Variable Linear Regression

• Polynomial Regression

• Non-inear Regression
